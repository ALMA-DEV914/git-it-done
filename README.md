### Featured Knowledge gained
* Learned that a server-side API is an interface for accessing another website's data.

* Familiarized yourself with how to read server-side API documentation.

* Used the browser's Fetch API to make requests to a server-side API.

* Gleaned additional information about requests being made, using the DevTools Network tab.

* Captured user input from the browser to create dynamic HTTP requests.

* Learned how to use an HTTP requestâ€™s response to display data to a user.

* Learned how to handle errors that may occur when working with server-side APIs.

* Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request separate from the data itself. For example, GitHub's Link header lets you know there are more pages of results to request.

* Leveraged another GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data. This endpoint also used an optional ? string to change how results are sorted.

* Used query parameters to pass information from one page to another.
